        <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
        <p> I am an I.T. Professional with over ten years experience working in various roles. I have worked in both the private sector 
            and for the government. I also have worked as a contractor working for well known and respected companies such as 
            Robert Half and Equity Staffing Solutions. My experience has given me the ability to adapt and work in different environments
            while maintaining a can do attitude! I believe my resume will speak for itself.</p>
